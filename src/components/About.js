      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>With over 5 years of experience as a Java developer, I have built scalable, maintainable back-end systems and designed and integrated RESTful APIs using Spring Boot. I have a strong understanding of SQL for database interactions and am skilled in automation scripting for deployment and production support tasks. I have hands-on experience using Splunk and Dynatrace for monitoring and troubleshooting. I ensure code quality through JUnit and Mockito for testing and use SonarCloud to maintain high standards. My work follows Agile methodologies, contributing to continuous integration and full SDLC processes.</p>
